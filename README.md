# Braille Reference
Brett Deaton - Spring 2023

A visual cheat sheet for English Braille (grade 2).

Deployed at [braille-reference-demo.netlify.app](https://braille-reference-demo.netlify.app/).

One of the aims of this project is long-term stability and minimal maintenance.
To that end, my rule is lean-to-no dependencies.
